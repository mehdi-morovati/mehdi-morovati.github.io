## *NeuraLint*
A DL program encodes the network structure of a desirable DL model and the process by which the model learns from the training dataset. Like any software, a DL program can be faulty, which implies substantial challenges of software quality assurance, especially in safety-critical domains. It is therefore crucial to equip DL development teams with efficient fault detection techniques and tools. To this end, we propose *NeuraLint*, a model-based fault detection approach for DL programs, using meta-modelling and graph transformations.
