I received my PhD at Department of Computer and Software Engineering, University of Montreal, Polytechnique Montreal. I am broadly interested in Software Engineering, and Machine Learning, focusing on testing ML-based software to improve the reliability of these software systems. I get most excited about developing quality assurance techniques that ensure reliability of ML-based software systemsto precisely and efficiently analyze, detect, and fix software bugs.
