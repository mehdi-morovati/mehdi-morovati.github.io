I received my PhD at Department of Computer and Software Engineering, University of Montreal, Polytechnique Montreal under supervision of Prof. Foutse Khomh. I am broadly interested in Software Engineering, and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on testing ML-based software to improve the reliability of these software systems. I get most excited about developing quality assurance techniques that ensure reliability of ML-based software systems to precisely and efficiently analyze, detect, and fix software bugs. My research primarily centers on the reliability and testing of ML and deep learning (DL) systems. I have developed methodologies for fault detection, characterization, and localization in ML-based software, aiming to enhance their robustness and dependability. My work has been recognized in journals such as *Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)*, *Automated Software Engineering (ASE)*, *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)*, and *Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)*.
